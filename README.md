# ObstacleAvoidingCar
<p><b>Objective: </b>This miniature car avoides obstacles using Ultrasonic sensor programmed in Arduino.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>Concepts Used: </b>This car uses ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, motors, and Arduino Uno microcontroller.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>How it works: </b>The ultrasonic sensor continuously scans the distance, and stops the motors if the distance is between 1cm to 60cm. As the sensor is mounted on a servo, it turns left and then scans the distance. Again, if the distance does not lie between 1cm to 60cm, the car turns left. However, if the left distance is between the range, it scans right and moves right. Although, if both the distances on right and left are in the range, it moves backwards and takes a slight turn towards left. </p>
